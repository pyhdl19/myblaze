Modifications to make it run better:


make uart char output to the simulation console not repeatedly duplicated:
[1] rtl/top.py line 547 when dmem_addr_out is high it writes the char
                        but it should only do when ena_in is asserted.


simulation screen output:

size=13
    traceSignals(): Deprecated usage: See http://dev.myhdl.org/meps/mep-114.html
  tb = myhdl.traceSignals(top.TopBench)
0:Hello, world!0:Hello, world!

now that the characters are printed each only once
